# hello-world
Hello!

My name is Josh and I am an aspiring computer scientist. This is my walkthrough of the github system.

What I learned:
  Created an open source repository
  Started and managed a new branch
  Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
  Opened and merged a Pull Request


Edited this on my Odin Project run in 2022
